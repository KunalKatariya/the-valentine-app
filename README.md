# Valentine's Proposal App ❤️

This is a creative, interactive web app designed to ask the big question.

## Features
- **Impossible "No" Button**: The button actively runs away from the cursor/finger.
- **Growing "Yes" Button**: Every attempt to click "No" makes the "Yes" button larger.
- **Celebration Mode**: Confetti explosion and cute animation when she says Yes.
- **Responsive**: Works on desktop and mobile.

## How to Run locally
1. Open a terminal in this folder.
2. Run `npm install` (if not already done).
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Open the link (usually http://localhost:5173).

## Customization
To change the text or images, edit `src/App.jsx`.
- **Text**: Look for the `phrases` array and the `<h1>` tag.
- **Images**: Improve the GIFs by changing the `src` URLs in `img` tags.

## Deployment
To share it with her, you can deploy this folder to Vercel or Netlify for free.
1. Run `npm run build`.
